            <h1>Hello! I'm David</h1>
            <h3>...and I've done a bunch of different stuff.</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I've been in restaurant management, retail, ISP Call Centers, Help Desk, Software Development, Application Support Engineering, and soon I'll be stepping into my company's Data Engineering team soon.</p>
            <p>I've loved computers since I first played with a beatup old Macintosh 128k that my brother found at a Yard Sale for $40.</p>
            <p>It started as a way to distract myself from the harsh reality I lived in.</p>
            <p>These days, I look back and see that it's enabled me in my career to help countless people with problems of all kinds. Helping those that helped me and more.</p>
            <p>I get enjoyment from simple moments like:</p>
            <p>Helping a grandmother reboot her router to get her connection back so she can video chat with her grandkids.</p>
            <p>Diving head first into application logs during an outage.</p>
            <p>Developing software for my team to automate the boring stuff.</p>
            <p>From infra to dev to support, I enjoy it all.</p>
            <p>I'm very happy where I am at the moment.
            <p>But feel free to have a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidimacias">LinkedIn</a> page</p>
