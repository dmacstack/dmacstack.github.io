            <h1>Hello! I'm David "Help me debug this" Macias</h1>
            <h3>A Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
            <p>To explain the core of who I am in a sentence: I solve problems.&nbsp;
              <br>It's what makes me, me.&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>Allow me to elaborate.... when I was in High School, my 3 of my good friends
              were in a Punk band. We all thought they were going to make it big, but
              they needed exposure. I said "You guys need a website!." I had no idea
              how to do that. I taught myself basic HTML(4), CSS, and Flash (yeah, I
              know). I went out and bought books, since there wasn't any solid learning
              material online in 2000. Within a month, I had their site up with animations
              and previews of their music.
              <br>Fast-forward to 2012... I started a job continuing my path of desktop
              support at a small but rapidly growing organization. Within the first month
              I decided to learn batch scripting to automate multi-step software installs
              and configurations, freeing us from hours of work each week. I was quickly
              promoted to a Senior / Lead role within the year. To continue to improve
              our workflow efficiency, I learned PowerShell and was able to leverage
              that gained knowledge to free up thousands of man-hours via scripting by
              writing GUI tools via combining WPF/.NET Framework + Powershell, and setting
              up company-wide software deployments . Without this, our team would have
              needed to add many more people than we could afford.
              <br>Soon I realized that development had become my primary role, soon I decided
              that I should take the plunge and go back to school, and after training
              my team members to their satisfaction, I pulled the plug and restarted
              my education. After completing my education at Coding Dojo, I feel like
              I've created a great stepping stone towards my future.

              <br>I very much enjoy the familiar MV* structure presented by Angular. It
